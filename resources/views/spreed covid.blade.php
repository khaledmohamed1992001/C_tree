                      <p> As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles
released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes.
 Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger
in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and
there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing
are essential to preventing COVID-19</p>
